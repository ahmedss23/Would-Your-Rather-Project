# Would You Rather Project

A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## How to Install and Run

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
